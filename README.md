WPSeed is part of the Grow Your Own WordPress Plugin service offered by Ryan Bayne.
                       
## Description 
                         
WPSeed is the Grow Your Own Plugin package. Created with strict WordPress standards and designed using the best approaches found in other popular plugins. This seed will stay familiar and simple. You'll be able to count on it and expand it in the way that suits each of your WP sites.

## Primary Purpose: Extensions 

WPSeed is the first plugin that exists purely to integrate two or more extensions without forcing a pre-determined purpose. This means that two new WP plugins can be created without the need to create an extensive interface, styling, script files, graphics or even independent project documentation. Instead, a developer can create multiple extensions to perform small jobs but integrate them by using WPSeed as the 'plugin in the middle' with all the advantages of a full size plugin i.e. full use of contextual help, careful installation wizard, the ability to force other plugins to be installed when they are part of a system, debugging functions, logging functions, and an existing community. The plugin will guide development and steer new WP developers down a path that encourages best practices all the way. 

## Extra Purpose: Boilerplate

The strict standards and lack of category for WPSeed makes it an ideal starting point. WPSeed can be used to create new plugins, as a secondary purpose. This has more to do with the development decisions made by Automattic when creating WooCommerce, the plugin that WPSeed is largely based on, rather than my innovation. Automattic has proven a plugin can be successful with minimal features and an extension system. WooCommerce success proves that keep a plugin as small as possible and relying on extensions offers the benefits of simple development. Some of the PHP class chosen to create WooCommerce (see credits and contributors for specifics) are the best of their kind. After days of research, I found myself returning to the same GitHub's that Automattic used. 

I'm not saying the WooCommerce way is the only way for all WP plugins but since creating WPSeed I feel it is the only way for my plugins. Again, the WPSeed core is massively copied from WooCommerce, with growing signs of my own engineering and preferences. I plan to use it to create a lot of plugins. When improving WPSeed I will not deviate from the perfect standards found within WooCommerce and I will not bloat the plugin with features. Making the plugin great to get to know, re-branding and building new plugins with.

If using WPSeed in that way. Please remember to give credit to Automattic for the engineering that inspires this project and credit to 'Ryan Bayne' for the overall WPSeed project.
